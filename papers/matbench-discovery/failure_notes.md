# Failure Notes — Paper-001

Classified blockers and discrepancies. Each entry: what, where, suspected cause,
status. A metric that does not reproduce is a *finding*, not a dead end.

## Classification tags
- `env` — dependency / install / platform issue
- `data` — data access, download, or schema drift
- `metric` — reproduced value differs from official
- `interp` — evaluation assumption that is easy to get wrong (documented, not a bug)

## Known evaluation assumptions to watch (interp) — identified 2026-07-02
- **5 eV/atom error filter** (`data.py:291-305`): predictions with
  `|e_form_pred − e_form_dft| > 5` are dropped to NaN *before* scoring and then
  counted as "predicted unstable". Skipping this changes F1/MAE. Reproduced in
  `compare_metrics.py`.
- **NaN = unstable** (`metrics/discovery.py`, `fillna=True`): missing predictions are
  scored as unstable, not excluded from classification (but excluded from MAE/RMSE/R²).
- **3-decimal rounding** of the merged frame (`preds/discovery.py:28`) happens before
  metrics are computed; must round to match the YAML.
- **Subset order**: filter is applied on the full set, *then* the `unique_prototypes`
  mask is applied.

## Findings so far (2026-07-02)

- **[env] PyPI wheel ≠ GitHub HEAD under the same version `1.3.1`.** The installed
  wheel has a *flat* layout (`matbench_discovery/metrics.py`, `preds.py`, `slurm.py`,
  `figshare/`), while the repo HEAD (commit `eaa7550`) has a restructured *package*
  layout (`metrics/discovery.py`, `preds/discovery.py`, `hpc.py`, `remote/`). Same
  version string, divergent code and import paths. Consequence: `pip install
  matbench-discovery` alone does not reproduce the repo's evaluation entrypoints; the
  repo scripts' imports (`from matbench_discovery.metrics.discovery import ...`) fail
  against the wheel. **Mitigation:** we audit the *cloned repo at the pinned commit*
  and use pip only for dependencies (`compare_metrics.py` prepends the clone to
  `sys.path`). This is a reproducibility observation to include in the report.

- **[env] Local Anaconda base Python is broken** (prefix resolves to CWD → venv fails).
  Not an upstream issue; used Store Python 3.11.9 instead. Documented so the env is
  reproducible.

- **[data] `pred_file_url` is WAF-blocked for naive downloaders.** The model YAML lists
  `pred_file_url: https://figshare.com/files/52057526`. A plain GET (urllib) returned a
  **0-byte** body → `pandas EmptyDataError`. The working endpoint is the Figshare API:
  `https://api.figshare.com/v2/file/download/52057526`. Upstream `remote/fetch.py`
  rewrites the URL internally, so users of the package don't see this — but an
  independent auditor hitting the URL directly does. `compare_metrics.py` now applies
  the same rewrite and validates the gzip magic bytes. Reproducibility note for report.

- **[env] Transient native crash (0xC0000005) on the download+compute run.** The first
  SevenNet run — the one that had to download the prediction CSV — hard-crashed with a
  Windows access violation and no Python traceback (exit 3221225477, ~9 s). The
  downloaded file was intact (2.62 MB, valid gzip). Re-running with the file cached
  succeeded twice (direct + wrapper) with identical, exact-match results. Not a data or
  metric defect; a native-layer flake correlated with doing an in-process HTTPS download
  immediately before heavy numpy/pandas work. **Mitigation if it recurs (e.g. MACE):**
  pre-download the CSV in a separate step, then run the compute (the file-exists check in
  `ensure_preds` makes the compute run skip the download).

## Open discrepancies
**None (2 of 2 models).** Layer A reproduced the official YAML exactly for **CHGNet**
and **SevenNet-0** on both `unique_prototypes` and `full_test_set` — every fraction to
3 dp and every integer confusion count (TP/FP/TN/FN) identical, via both an independent
re-implementation and the upstream `stable_metrics`. See `metric_check.md` and
`metric_check-sevennet.md`.
